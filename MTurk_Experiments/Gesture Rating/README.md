The folders include the gesture rating experiments for emotional facial expressions and body gestures. Experiments conducted in Amazon Mechanical Turk, using psiturk (https://psiturk.org/) and jspsych (https://www.jspsych.org/). 

The static video files used for each experiment can be found in SFU Radar research repository:

Face Gestures = https://researchdata.sfu.ca/islandora/object/islandora%3A10712
Body Gestures = https://researchdata.sfu.ca/islandora/object/islandora%3A10705

In both experiments, participants were asked to rate each gesture video using Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance (PAD) scale of Mehrabian (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF02686918) with the Self Assessment Manikin (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7962581):
