	    <p>
	      In this study, we are interested in how people respond to 30 short videos (5 second) that represent
	      different facial gestures. You will be looking at different videos projected on
	      the screen in front of you, and you will be rating each video in terms of what kind of expression you think it was. There are no right or wrong answers, so simply
	      respond as honestly as you can.
	    <p/>
	    <p>
	      You will see 3 sets of 7 figures, each arranged along a continuum. You will be using
	      these figures to rate how you felt while viewing each videos. The experiment will take approximately 10 minutes.
