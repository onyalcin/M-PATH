	    <p>
	      In this study, we are interested in how people respond to pictures that represent
	      different facial expressions. You will be looking at different pictures projected on
	      the screen in front of you, and you will be rating each picture in terms of how it
	      made you feel while viewing it. There are no right or wrong answers, so simply
	      respond as honestly as you can.
	    <p/>
	    <p>
	      You will see 3 sets of 7 figures, each arranged along a continuum. You will be using
	      these figures to rate how you felt while viewing each picture.

	    <p>
	      The first set is the happy-unhappy scale. At one extreme of the scale you felt
	      happy, pleased, satisfied, contented, hopeful. 
	      
	      The other end of the scale is when you felt completely, unhappy, annoyed, unsatisfied,
	      melancholic, despaired, bored.

	    <p>
	    The excited vs. calm dimension is the second type of feeling displayed here. At one
	    extreme of the scale you felt stimulated, excited, frenzied, jittery, wide-awake,
	    aroused. 

	    At the other extreme of the scale, you felt completely relaxed, calm, sluggish, dull,
	    sleepy, unaroused.
	    </p>

	    <p>
	    The third scale is the dimension of controlled vs. in-control. At one end of
	    the scale you have feelings characterized as completely controlled,
	    influenced, cared-for, awed, submissive, guided.

	    At the other extreme of this scale, you felt completely controlling, influential, in
	    control, important, dominant, autonomous.
